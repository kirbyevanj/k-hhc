name: Python Package (Standalone)

# This is a standalone workflow for building Python packages independently
# The main CI workflow includes Python building as part of the pipeline
# Use this workflow for:
# - Manual testing of Python builds
# - Debugging Python packaging issues
# - Building wheels without running full CI
